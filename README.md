This program makes a simulation of a Quadruped moving, but it can also be used to move the robot in real life. To move the robot, the user will use pre-made methods in a new programming language called Swiffee. Kids who would like to try testing a Quadruped, but don't have one, can use this simulation. It is also useful to try coding and using robots in an easy and simple way. 

The program uses Swiffee to make coding simple and easy with simple methods that can be used in many ways. There is also a simulation of the Quadruped to mimic what it would look like in real life. To use Swiffee, there is a simple IDE and a terminal to show how the Quadruped is working and if there are any errors.

Instructions:
• The Swiffee API: 
• 

Classes used:
Swiffee - the analyzer of the code the user inputs
Simulator - the graphics of the Quadruped in the window
