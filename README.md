@date April 9, 2019

This program makes a simulation of a Quadruped moving, but it can also be used to move the robot in real life. To move the robot, the user will use pre-made methods. Kids who would like to try testing a Quadruped, but don't have one, can use this simulation. It is also useful to try coding and using robots in an easy and simple way. 

There is also a simulation of the Quadruped to mimic what it would look like in real life. To code, there is a simple IDE and a terminal to show how the Quadruped is working and if there are any errors. New coders can easily code with simple methods that can be used in many ways.

Instructions:
Open the window and start coding with The Java API (no need to worry, you need to code in java and you definitely know this language): <a href = "https://lakshbhambhani.github.io/Swiffee-Minikame-Simulator/">Java API</a> or https://lakshbhambhani.github.io/Swiffee-Minikame-Simulator/

Classes used:

| Class Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Java | the analyzer of the code the user inputs |
| SimulatorWindow | the window and graphics of the Quadruped |
| Simulator | the panel drawing the body and legs of the Quadruped |
| Body | the blueprint class representing the body of the Quadruped |
| Legs | the blueprint class representing the legs of the Quadruped |
| FullBody | the class instantiating the Body and Legs classes |
| SFTPBean | protocol for sending the code the user programmed to the robot |
| ScpTo | calls SFTPBean to send code to robot |
| ConnectToBot | executes the code on the robot |

Responsibilities:
Laksh does things not in java while I do simple simulator stuff
